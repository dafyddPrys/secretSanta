# Secret santa generator

This simple web application allows you to generate secret santa matches without anyone knowing the pairings. This means you no longer have to get a third party to create names or create some kind of complex system to avoid naming collisions.

This is still very much a work in progress!

## Running

After cloning and `npm install`ing, run `npm run start-dev` to run in node.
